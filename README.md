This app is a successful completion utilizing the tutorial and susequent Github updates by Chimezie Enyinnaya.

I utilized:
-  Adonis 5
-  Node

-  Postgres

To start the application, run node ace serve --watch in the terminal in the project.  Once the server address pops up in the terminal, control click on it to open it in the browser.
